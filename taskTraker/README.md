# Simple Task Tracker Command Line Program
https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker
## Overview

This simple project is used to track the tasks you have. It is built with Node.js and serves as my first small backend project. I created it to learn how to work with the `fs` (file system) module, which is used to interact with files and directories on your operating system.

## How to Use It: 

1. Clone this repository.
2. In the project directory, open a terminal and type `npm install -g`.

The command line tool will now be installed on your machine, and you can use it.

type `track --help` in your command line to see usage instructions.


## Directory Structure

1. `cli` folder: Contains the main JavaScript file that handles all user arguments.
2. `data` folder: Contains the JSON file where tasks are stored.
3. `utils` folder: Contains all the functions used to handle user commands.
